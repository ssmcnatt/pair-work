In your pair, create a markdown file answering the following:

Identify 3 scenarios in your everyday life where you use probability.
	1) Getting an Ace when choosing a card from a deck in straight draw poker
	2) Probability of getting the right answer on a trivia questions (5 answers)
	3) Buying groceries

Using the formula you learned to calculate probabilities, approximate the probabilities of the events in each of those 3 scenarios.

	1) P(Ace) = 4/52 = 0.769 = 7.7%
	2) P(correct) = 1/5 = 0.2 = 20%

Think about what potential dependencies the events in each of your 3 scenarios have. Calculate the joint probabilities for the events and their dependencies.

	1) Have other cards been taken out of the deck, how many aces are left?
	2) How knowledgeable are you about the trivia question subject, how confident are you with choosing the right answer

Calculate the conditional probabilities for the events given their dependencies.

	1) 15 cards are out of the deck, so 37 are left
	   There are 3 Aces left in the deck

		P(Ace | above) = 3/37 = 0.081 = 8.1%

	2)
